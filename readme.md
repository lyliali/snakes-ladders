# Snakes and Ladders

Snakes and Ladders is a simple web implementation of the game using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

## Description

I created this project in order to deepen my understanding of basic web design and JavaScript concepts that I learned on freeCodeCamp.org.

This project features introductory concepts including: 

* The HTML Document Object Model
* HTML Classes and IDs
* Responsive Design
* CSS Grids
* Event listeners
* Arrays and For Loops in JavaScript

## Installation

Playing the game locally is as simple as downloading the root directory and opening index.html in a web browser of your choice.

## Project Status

I consider this project to be finished at MVP (minimum viable product) state. Below are my ideas for polishing and extending this project:

**Polish**

* Add WASD / arrow keyboard controls to roll and hover over tiles
* Animate the roll feature by highlighting each tile that is passed over between the player's current position to their final position
* Add sound effects
* Add some kind of time-out that corresponds to the average player's attention span, so that instead of getting bored and never finishing the game, the page redirects them to the final YouTube video right *before* they get bored

**Extension**

* Allow multiple players

## Contributing

I'd love to hear your feedback, especially on the code, game experience, visual layout of the webpage, and of course, if there are any bugs I haven't discovered. Please feel free to email me at lyliax@gmail.com!
