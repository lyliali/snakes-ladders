# Snakes and Ladders

Snakes and Ladders is a simple web implementation of the game using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

## Description

I created this project in order to deepen my understanding of basic web design and JavaScript concepts that I learned on freeCodeCamp.org.

This project features introductory concepts including: 

* The HTML Document Object Model
* HTML Classes and IDs
* Responsive Design
* CSS Grids
* Event listeners
* Arrays and For Loops in JavaScript

## Installation

Playing the game locally is as simple as downloading the root directory and opening index.html in a web browser of your choice.

## Project Status

I consider this project to be finished at MVP (minimum viable product) state. Below are my ideas for polishing and extending this project:

**Polish**

* Add WASD / arrow keyboard controls to roll and hover over tiles
* Animate the roll feature by highlighting each tile that is passed over between the player's current position to their final position
* Add sound effects

**Extension**

* Allow multiple players
